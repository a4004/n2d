  Latest Build Updates

<p>
  Stage 3 of development has just started (25/02/21) which means the program is a working prototype however it isn't stable for normal use. Last minute GUI changes might 
  happen should I feel it's necessary. As for release, due to global pandemic circumstances and the upcoming easing of restrictions in the United Kingdom, development
  will be prolonged which likely means a delayed release date if Stage 4 is to commence normally but I'll probably end up releasing an RC edition for public testing.
