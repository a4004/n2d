<h3> 
  An easy to use ESP8266 flash GUI powered by the official esptool.py software. 
</h3>

<h2>
  28/02/21 | Build Update
</h2>
<p>
  The project GUI has been revamped (inspired by Balena Etcher) and many issues have been fixed, though as it is a rewrite, full functionality has not yet been re-implemented 
  and will be done over the next week. The official release date has been pushed back to the 15th of March to allow time for quality control and eradication of bugs. If you're
  interested in obtaining alpha copies of the program, contact me on Discord @realmrvodka#4269 or via a Matrix-compatible IM client at mrvodka@matrix.org.
